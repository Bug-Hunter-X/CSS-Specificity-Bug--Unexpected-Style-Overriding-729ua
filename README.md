# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to CSS selector specificity. The problem arises from the way CSS handles specificity when multiple selectors target the same element.  A more specific selector is unexpectedly overridden by a seemingly less specific one due to the way specificity is calculated in CSS.

## Problem Description

The bug highlights a situation where an ID selector (`#myElement`), which typically has high specificity, is overridden by a more complex selector that combines class and ID selectors (`.container #myElement`).  This unexpected behavior is caused by CSS's specificity calculation which prioritizes the combined selector due to its composition.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates how to resolve this conflict.  By understanding CSS specificity, we ensure the desired styles are applied.
