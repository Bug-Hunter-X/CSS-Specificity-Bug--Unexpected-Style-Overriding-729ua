To solve this issue, we can either:

1. **Adjust the selector order:** Place the most specific selector first in your CSS. This usually fixes most specificity issues.

2. **Use the `!important` flag (generally discouraged):**  While effective, this approach can lead to difficulties in maintenance.  Avoid using `!important` whenever possible.

Here's an updated CSS file with a solution that correctly applies the ID selector's styles:

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

#myElement {
  background-color: lightcoral; /* This style is now correctly applied */
}

.container #myElement {
  background-color: lightgreen; /* This is now overridden by the #myElement selector */
}
```

By using the correct order and carefully choosing the selector, we ensure that `#myElement` style is successfully applied.
