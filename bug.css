The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon issue where the specificity of selectors leads to unexpected behavior:

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

#myElement {
  background-color: lightcoral; /* This style should override the previous one, but it does not */
}

.container #myElement {
  background-color: lightgreen; /* This is the style that is actually applied */
}

```

The `#myElement` selector has higher specificity than `.container`, but the more specific `.container #myElement` selector overrides it. This happens because CSS calculates specificity based on the number and types of selectors used, not just the hierarchy.  The combined selector `.container #myElement` has higher specificity due to the inclusion of two selectors (class and ID).
